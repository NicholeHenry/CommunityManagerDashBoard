# CommunityManagerDashBoard
The Application will be a management tool for a small residential community. 
It will give the the manager of the community the ability to create a database of residents and their individual information 
and also search through that information to find a specific resident.
The application will also have an information space to display information to the residents that does not require a password to see the information.
